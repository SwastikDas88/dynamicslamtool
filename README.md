This branch has initial testing codes. It was just trail and errors on different methods to detect moving point clouds within consecutive pointcloud frames using the odometry data. Includes the tesing code for directional cloud approach for the moving object detection. Couldn't work out with better results and hence skipped with clustering approach.

The directional cloud approach has a good potential to detect the movement direction in 2D or 3D. It can be used for direction vector estimation of the moving sensor. Although the method couldn't be used in the work but it can be used to estimate the direction of translation of a LIDAR without any use of inertial sensors.
